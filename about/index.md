I am currently a SNSF postdoctoral fellow at MIT CSAIL, supervised by Stefanie Jegelka. Previously, I completed my PhD  at EPFL, where I was supervised by Andreas Loukas and Pierre Vandergheynst.
My research focus is at the intersection of combinatorial optimization and machine learning, where I develop novel methods that utilize neural networks to solve diverse combinatorial and algorithmic problems. Outside of research, I love doing parkour. Finally, I'm a big fan of the original matrix trilogy so I might occassionally post about that here as well.
