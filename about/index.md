<p>
My name is Nikos Karalias and I am a PhD candidate at EPFL, supervised by Andreas Loukas and Pierre Vandergheynst.
My research focuses on neural combinatorial optimization and algorithmic reasoning. I will be posting mostly about research 
updates on this website, mixed with occassional personal rambles if I feel inspired enough.
