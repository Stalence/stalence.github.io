<p>
I am a PhD candidate at EPFL, supervised by Andreas Loukas and Pierre Vandergheynst.
My work is focused on finding ways to train neural networks that can solve diverse combinatorial and algorithmic problems.
Whenever I'm not doing research, you'll find me doing parkour or bouldering. I also love the Matrix Trilogy, so I'm sure there will be posts about that at some point.
