I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at CSAIL, supervised by Stefanie Jegelka. Previously, I completed my PhD  at EPFL, where I was supervised by Andreas Loukas and Pierre Vandergheynst.
I am interested in finding ways to train neural networks that can solve diverse combinatorial and algorithmic problems. Outside of research, I love [parkour][1]. Finally, I'm a big fan of the original matrix trilogy so I might occassionally post about that here as well.
