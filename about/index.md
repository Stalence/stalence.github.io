<p>
I am a PhD candidate at EPFL, supervised by Andreas Loukas and Pierre Vandergheynst.
My research focuses on coming up with ways to train neural networks that can solve diverse combinatorial problems.
Here I will be mostly posting research updates, mixed with occassional personal rambles if I feel inspired enough.
