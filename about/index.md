<p>I am currently a SNSF postdoctoral fellow at MIT CSAIL, supervised by Stefanie Jegelka. Previously, I completed my PhD  at EPFL, where I was supervised by Andreas Loukas and Pierre Vandergheynst.
My research focus is at the intersection of combinatorial optimization and machine learning, where I develop novel methods that utilize neural networks to solve diverse combinatorial and algorithmic problems.
Recently, I have been working on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Designing neural network-based algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems that can provide solution quality certificates and/or worst-case guarantees.</li>
  <li>Learning and reasoning over discrete structures. Learning to solve optimization problems with constraints.</li>
  <li>Rounding/discretization of neural net solutions to combinatorial problems. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a student interested in working with me in any of those areas feel free to shoot me an email!</p>

<p>Outside of research, I love doing parkour and playing the drums. I will post more content related to my research on this website such as tutorials or practical
    guides for combinatorial ML. However, I may occassionally write something about other topics (love the Matrix Trilogy!).</p>
