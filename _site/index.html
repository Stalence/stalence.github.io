        <p>This post is meant to serve as an intuitive and practical explainer of our work on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04055">neural set function extensions</a>, recently presented at NeurIPS 2022. As in previous posts, I will be skipping potentially important details in the interest of brevity and understandability. For the full details, I recommend reading the paper or even just emailing me. Now, let’s get started.</p>

<h2 id="high-level-motivation">High level motivation</h2>
<p>A commonly encountered challenge when using neural networks is when we learn some continuous representations for discrete entities and we would like to perform
discrete/algorithmic computations over those entities in an end-to-end differentiable fashion. Discrete computations often require discrete inputs and introduce non-differentiabilities in our pipeline. In the paper, we focus our attention specifically on discrete functions. Our goal: to make such functions which are defined on discrete inputs (e.g., sets of items) compatible with continuous inputs (e.g., embeddings of neural networks) while allowing to backpropagate through them in neural network pipelines.</p>

<h2 id="concrete-setup-and-ways-to-approach-it">Concrete setup and ways to approach it</h2>
<p>Suppose that you have a neural network which produces a score vector \(\mathbf{x} \in [0,1]^{n}\) given some input problem instance (a graph, an image, etc.), which is then used to solve some downstream task. That vector could be marginal probabilities of graph nodes for some kind of node selection task, or even the class probabilities for a classification task. To make the presentation more concrete, we will treat \(\mathbf{x}\) as marginal probabilities for node selection, i.e., \(x_i\) is the probability that node \(i\) belongs to a set of nodes \(S\) that is meant to solve some graph problem (a set that optimizes some kind of objective function).</p>

<p>Now assume that you have a function \(f: 2^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) whose input is any subset of \(n\) items. We can view the domain of \(f\) as the space of n-dimensional binary vectors, i.e., \(f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\). I’m obviously abusing notation here to emphasize that the <em>inputs</em> of this function are <em>discrete</em>, however the <em>outputs</em> are allowed to be <em>continuous</em>. 
The input domain consists of all the possible indicator vectors for all the subsets of \(n\) items we could pick. For example, let’s assume \(f\) is the cardinality function, i.e., the function that counts how many items the provided set has. Then for \(n=3\), a set \(S\) could be represented by a 3-dimensional binary vector, e.g., \(\mathbf{1}_S= \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}\). In the case of that example vector, clearly the cardinality is \(f(S) = f(\mathbf{1}_S) = 2\).</p>

<p>Naturally, that kind of function is not compatible with arbitrary \(\mathbf{x}\) due to the continuity of \(\mathbf{x}\). It doesn’t make much sense to ask what is the cardinality of (for example) \(\begin{bmatrix} 0.3 &amp; 0.5 &amp; 0.2 \end{bmatrix}\) to begin with.  If we want to find a set that minimizes (or maximizes) the function by improving the scores in \(\mathbf{x}\) in a differentiable neural network pipeline, we have to square away this incompatibility.
Here, there are certain options one would consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Discretize the continuous output. We could sample with the Gumbel trick or even just threshold the values of \(\mathbf{x}\) to obtain a binary vector that represents a set. We could then use a <a href="https://www.hassanaskary.com/python/pytorch/deep%20learning/2020/09/19/intuitive-explanation-of-straight-through-estimators.html#what-is-a-straight-through-estimator">straight-through estimator</a> in the backward pass to go through the discretization procedure. While this provides a discrete vector that \(f\) is compatible with, it may only work if the function \(f\) itself <em>is differentiable</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assume the function \(f\) is a black box, so we have no guarantees that we can differentiate through it. In that case, some kind of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00123">stochastic gradient estimation</a> might be our next option. For example we could use REINFORCE, i.e., sample sets \(S\) from \(\mathbf{x}\) then use the log-derivative trick to backpropagate through \(\mathbf{x}\) while treating \(f\) as the reward function.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use a known continuous relaxation of the function. Again, that assumes that we have access to the function and a bespoke relaxation exists. That does not 
require any discretization. When available, it’s a pretty good option.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="our-solution">Our solution</h2>
<p>These are all valid approaches that could make sense in certain scenarios. Here, we will propose a different strategy that aims to mitigate the drawbacks of the listed approaches. Namely, our approach can deal with functions in a black-box setting, 
First, we can go back to the main obstacle we started from. What does it mean to ask about the cardinality of the input (value of the discrete function) when the input is not a set (binary vector) but a vector of continuous values?  There is a way to make this question well-posed. We can treat the continuous values as parameters of a probability distribution over sets. Then we can ask what is the <em>expected value of the function</em> over the distribution of sets encoded by \(\mathbf{x}\).</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-scalar-set-function-extension-it-is-simply-a-new-differentiable-function-mathfrakf-01n-rightarrow-mathbbr--which-extends-the-discrete-domain-of-the-original-function-to-a-continuous-domain-we-will-define-it-as-the-expected-value-of-the-function-f-over-a-distribution-of-sets-encoded-by-mathbfx">What is a scalar set function extension? It is simply a new differentiable function \(\mathfrak{F}: [0,1]^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)  which <em>extends</em> the discrete domain of the original function to a continuous domain. We will define it as the expected value of the function \(f\) over a distribution of sets encoded by \(\mathbf{x}\).</h3>

<p>That means that we will be going from a function defined on the corners of the hypercube \(\{0,1\}^n\) to a function defined on the whole hypercube \([0,1]^n\).
The main objective of the paper is to provide a foundation for this approach. It is a general framework for constructing continuous extensions of discrete functions defined on sets, that can be <em>deterministically</em> computed, even when we’re only given black-box access to \(f\). The paper presents multiple extensions that originate from a common mathematical formulation. Some are already known like the Lovász extension, and others are new, like the bounded cardinality Lovász extension. Furthermore, we provide a way to not only extend to continuous domains, but also onto <em>high-dimensional</em> ones. We will explore this in an upcoming post (part 2 of the series).</p>
<hr />

<h2 id="scalar-extensions-explained">Scalar extensions explained</h2>
<p>We call  \(\mathfrak{F}\) a scalar extension of a function \(f\), if  \(\mathfrak{F}(\mathbf{1}_S) = f(S)\) for all \(S\) in the domain of \(f\). For example,  \(\mathfrak{F}(\mathbf{0}) = f(\emptyset)\), i.e., the extension evaluated at the origin (all-zeros vector) should correspond to \(f\) being evaluated at the empty set.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-you-compute--mathfrakf">How can you compute  \(\mathfrak{F}\)?</h3>
<p>There is a simple trick to defining \(\mathfrak{F}\). As explained earlier, we can view \(\mathbf{x}\) as encoding a distribution over sets.
 To do this, we can express any continuous point in the n-hypercube \(\mathbf{x} \in [0,1]^n\) in the following way:</p>
<h4 id="displaystyle--mathbfx--sum_i-a_i-mathbf1_s_i-quad-displaystyle-sum_i-a_i--1">\(\displaystyle  \mathbf{x} = \sum_{i} a_i \mathbf{1}_{S_i}, \quad \displaystyle \sum_i a_i = 1.\)</h4>
<p>In other words, for every continuous point in the hypercube, we can find certain corners of the hypercube and express said point as a convex combination of those corners. This defines a distribution:</p>
<h4 id="mathbfx---displaystylemathbbe_s-sim-mathbfp_xs">\(\mathbf{x} =  \displaystyle\mathbb{E}_{S \sim \mathbf{p_x}}[S]\).</h4>
<p>Here \(\mathbf{p_x}\) is the probability distribution induced by \(\mathbf{x}\). This distribution is fully described by the coefficients \(a_i\) in the convex combination.
Once we have \(S_i\) and \(a_i\) defining \(\mathfrak{F}\)  is simple:</p>
<h4 id="mathfrakfmathbfx--triangleq-displaystylesum_i-a_i-fs_i--mathbbe_s-sim-mathbfp_xfs">\(\mathfrak{F}(\mathbf{x})  \triangleq \displaystyle\sum_{i} a_i f({S_i}) = \mathbb{E}_{S \sim \mathbf{p_x}}[f(S)]\).</h4>
<p>The distribution is supported only on sets \(S_i\) and each set has a corresponding probability of \(a_i\).
Intuitively, the value of the extension at the continuous point is just a weighted combination of the values of the original function \(f\) at the corners that form the convex combination of \(\mathbf{x}\). Furthermore, the weights of the weighted combination are precisely the same weights used to express \(\mathbf{x}\) as a convex combination of hypercube corners.</p>

<p>A large chunk of the paper is dedicated to properly formalizing this trick. Obviously, I will keep things simple here so I won’t get into all that. I encourage the curious reader to check out the paper.
Now, there are a couple of questions that naturally have to be addressed. One has to do with how we find those sets \(S_i\) and their coefficients \(a_i\). Is it computationally tractable? Can we do it fast? 
The other has to do with whether this thing is differentiable at all? 
Tha answer to all those questions is, modulo certain disclaimers, yes.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-we-backpropagate-through-mathfrakfmathbfx">How can we backpropagate through \(\mathfrak{F}(\mathbf{x})\)?</h3>
<p>The trick for this is simple. As long as \(a_i = g(\mathbf{x})\), and \(g\) is some continuous function of \(\mathbf{x}\), then gradients can just go through
the coefficients \(a_i\) in the sum that defines \(\mathfrak{F}(\mathbf{x})\).</p>

<h3 id="how-do-we-find-sets-s_i-and-their-coefficients-a_i">How do we find sets \(S_i\) and their coefficients \(a_i\)?</h3>
<p>In the paper we provide multiple examples of scalar extensions. Each one comes with its own way of computing sets \(S_i\) and their probabilities \(a_i\). Crucially, the coefficients \(a_i\) depend continuously on \(\mathbf{x}\) which allows us to do backpropagation.  The ‘cheapest’ extensions that require only black-box access to the function \(f\) are the Lovász extension, the bounded-cardinality Lovász extension, the singleton, and the permutation/involutory extensions.
These all require \(n+1\) sets (including the empty set) and coefficients.  Before I go into specific extensions and how to compute them, I want to emphasize that the key point to remember is that you could find your own extensions by figuring out ways to express continuous points as convex combinations of discrete points. I may discuss some general strategies for this in a future post but for now I will just leave it at that.</p>
<hr />

<h2 id="in-practice-the-lovász-extension">In practice: The Lovász extension</h2>
<p>The Lovász extension is well known in the fields of discrete analysis/optimization and submodularity. It has various particularly nice properties but perhaps the most important one is that iff \(f\) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submodular_set_function">submodular function</a>, then the Lovász extension of \(f\) is convex. Examples of submodular functions include graph cuts, coverage functions, rank functions, and so on. 
Computing the Lovász extension is straightforward.
First, we index the entries of \(\mathbf{x}\) in sorted, decreasing order: \(x_i \geq x_{i+1}\) for \(i=1,2,\dots , n-1\). That means that \(x_1\) corresponds to the dimension with the largest entry in \(\mathbf{x}\), \(x_2\) to the second largest, and so on.
The coefficients and the sets of the Lovász extension are then defined as follows:</p>
<h3 id="a_i--x_i---x_i1">\(a_i = x_i - x_{i+1}\)</h3>
<h3 id="s_i--1i-">\(S_i = \{1:i \}\).</h3>
<p>Here, I’m using a bit of coding notation with \(1:i\) to indicate “all elements up to \(i\)”.
Given the sets and their coefficients, the Lovász extension is computed by</p>
<h3 id="mathfrakfmathbfx--displaystyle-sum_i1n--x_i---x_i1f-1-i--">\(\mathfrak{F}(\mathbf{x}) = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n}  (x_i - x_{i+1})f( \{1: i \} )\).</h3>
<p>Clearly, \(a_i\) are differentiable with respect to \(\mathbf{x}\) as they’re just pairwise differences of the coordinates of \(\mathbf{x}\).
To make things concrete, let’s do the calculation to find sets and coefficients for our example vector from before: \(\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.3 &amp; 0.5 &amp; 0.2\end{bmatrix}\).
Based on the ranking of the elements, we will have the following sets</p>
<h3 id="1_s_1--beginbmatrix-0--1--0-endbmatrix-1_s_2--beginbmatrix-1--1--0-endbmatrix-1_s_3--beginbmatrix-1--1--1-endbmatrix">\(1_{S_1} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}, 1_{S_2} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}, 1_{S_3} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}\),</h3>
<p>and the following coefficients</p>
<h3 id="a_1--05-03--02">\(a_1 = 0.5-0.3 = 0.2,\)</h3>
<h3 id="a_2--03-02--01">\(a_2 = 0.3-0.2 = 0.1,\)</h3>
<h3 id="a_3--02-">\(a_3 = 0.2\) .</h3>
<p>It is easy to verify that \(\mathbf{x} = \sum_{i} a_i \mathbf{1}_{S_i}\). One might notice that \(\sum_i a_i  &lt;1\) in this case, even though I initially said that we need a sum to one. Thankfully, that’s not a problem because we can allocate the remaining probability mass to the empty set. By convention \(f(\emptyset) = 0\) so that term just cancels out. Therefore, we don’t strictly need the sum to 1, \(\sum_i a_i \leq 1\) can also be fine.</p>

<h2 id="converting-discrete-objectives-to-loss-functions-for-combinatorial-optimization-and-beyond">Converting discrete objectives to loss functions for combinatorial optimization and beyond</h2>
<p>A standard use case for extensions in practice is when we have some kind of quantity of interest that is defined over sets of objects and we would like to find a set that optimizes it. This is a sufficiently general setting that could encompass graph and combinatorial problems, classification problems, NLP problems, etc. Extensions can let us do that by finding the continuous version of that quantity through \(\mathfrak{F}\) and then backpropagating to find representations that optimize it.</p>

<h2 id="combinatorial-objectives">Combinatorial objectives</h2>
<p>Let’s look at a simple application of extensions to combinatorial optimization. Consider the graph cut function. It is a submodular set function, that given a set \(S\) of nodes in an input graph \(G\), it counts the number of edges that have one endpoint inside \(S\) and one endpoint outside of \(S\) in the graph. It is known that finding a set that maximizes the graph cut is an NP-Hard problem. Minimizing it is by default in \(P\) (can you guess why?), however adding a simple cardinality constraint can make minimization NP-Hard as well. A way to tackle the problem of optimizing the cut (either min or max) could be to provide a graph instance on \(n\) nodes to a neural network and then generate some scores for the nodes of the graph \(\mathbf{x} \in [0,1]^n\). That’s where the extensions come in. Here we can use the extension of the graph cut function as a loss function to optimize. Then we can backpropagate through the neural network scores \(\mathbf{x}\) and update the parameters of the network using the extension as a loss function. Normally, that wouldn’t be possible because we wouldn’t be able to backpropagate through an arbitrary set function.</p>

<p>Now, the graph cut function happens to admit a bunch of continuous relaxations that are well known. One of those is the graph total variation \(TV(\mathbf{x};G) = \displaystyle\sum_{(x_i&gt;x_j)} (x_i-x_j)w_{i,j}\), where \(w_{i,j}\) is the weight for any edge \((i,j)\) in the graph \(G\). It turns out that the Lovász Extension of the graph cut function is precisely the TV function so this is a case where a bespoke relaxation is naturally absorbed in our framework. However, the same trick could be done for any other combinatorial problem. Take its objective function \(g(S)\) and a function that encodes the constraint \(c(S)\). For instance, for the maximum clique problem, \(g(S)\) is the number of nodes of \(S\), which we seek to maximize. The constraint \(c(S)\) on the other hand can just be a binary signal, it can be defined as follows:</p>
<h3 id="cs--begincases-1--textif-the-set-is-a-clique--0--text-otherwise-endcases">\(c(S) = \begin{cases} 1 \; \text{if the set is a clique,} \\ 0 \; \text{ otherwise.} \end{cases}\)</h3>
<p>Then we may combine \(c\) and \(g\) into \(f(S) = c(S)g(S)\). This is now a discrete set function which we can attempt to maximize in order to solve the maximum clique problem. We compute its continuous extension and use that as a loss function in order to find a score vector \(\mathbf{x}\) that encodes a distribution of sets \(S\) that best solves the problem.</p>

<h2 id="putting-it-all-together-a-recipe-for-solving-problems-with-extensions">Putting it all together: A recipe for solving problems with extensions</h2>
<p>To summarize, here are 4 steps to start solving problems with extensions. Assuming you have some discrete function \(f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) and you are looking for subsets of \(n\) objects that give you the optimal value for that function.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Step 1: Get a neural network and an input instance (image, graph, whatever).</li>
  <li>Step 2: Generate scores \(\mathbf{x} \in [0,1]^n\). The dimension \(n\) may be the number of nodes of a graph, the number of classes for classification, etc.</li>
  <li>Step 3: Compute an extension \(\mathfrak{F}\) of the function \(f\). Use \(\mathfrak{F}\) (with an appropriate sign for minimization/maximization) as your loss function.</li>
  <li>Step 4: To decide on a set for the solution to the problem, generate the sets \(S\) of the extension and pick whichever gives you the best value for \(f\).</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s pretty much it. In the paper we apply those steps to do combinatorial optimization but we also show how they can be used for image classification by defining an extension for the discrete training error function (the possible input subsets there are just the \(n\) possible class labels that are represented by one-hot binary vectors). From brief discussions I’ve had 
at NeurIPS 2022, it seems like this kind of trick could be applied to other settings like NLP or VAEs. Those applications are left as an exercise to the reader :)</p>
<hr />

<h2 id="to-be-continued-neural-extensions">To be continued: Neural Extensions</h2>
<p>Conceptually, this post has dealt with the first half of the paper. I intentionally avoided discussing the meaning of the word <em>scalar</em> in the subtitle of the post. The characterization of <em>scalar</em> set function extensions has to do with the domain of the extension. If the extensions work on the hypercube like \(\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow  [0,1]^n\), we are assigning a single scalar continuous score to each item among \(n\) items. In part 2 of this series, we will see how we can stretch the definition of extensions to allow for extensions of the form \(\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow  [0,1]^{n \times d}\), i.e., \(d\)-dimensional embeddings for each item, which is usually the kind of representation that the layers of a neural network operate with (\(d\) would just be the width of a NN). 
But that’s a story for another time. Until then, I hope this has been helpful.</p>

        <h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer:</h3>
<p>This is a brief tutorial on the probabilistic penalty method presented in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10643">paper</a>. I will be taking shortcuts in how I present it in order to make it straightforward and understandable. It does not cover the paper in its full generality. I will not explain the probabilistic method and I won’t expand on the various important details that constitute the full paper.
Instead, I aim to provide an accessible primer into our work by minimizing the technical info and focusing on practicality/simplicity. I encourage you to read the paper and the supplementary material section for the complete treatment. Otherwise, if you’re still unsure, just email me. Without further ado, let’s get started.</p>

<h2 id="erdos-goes-neural-a-simplified-tutorial">Erdos goes neural: a simplified tutorial</h2>

<h3 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries:</h3>
<p>Before we start, we should clear up what the goal of this work is. The main objective is to solve combinatorial problems with neural networks, 
<strong>without supervision</strong> (i.e., without access to labeled solutions). We focused on graph problems but the principles of our method can be applied to other settings. Furthermore, many (combinatorial) problems have an equivalent graph formulation, so you could reformulate your problem in a graph setting if you want to be as close to what we did as possible.</p>

<p>OK, great. Now that this is out of the way, let’s talk about how we are going to get things done.
First, let’s be a bit more specific with the setup.</p>

<p>We want a set of objects \(S\) that solves a given problem, e.g., finds the set of nodes that forms the largest possible clique on a graph (maximum clique problem). 
Since we focused on graph problems in the paper, we will work with sets of nodes on the input graph, but you can also do sets of edges/tuples/etc. It will depend on your particular problem and what is more convenient for you. 
<strong>From now on I will be talking about sets of nodes. Feel free to substitute it with edges or whatever else you need to work with.</strong></p>

<p>Here is what we are going to need:</p>
<h4 id="1-a-combinatorial-problem-with-a-nonnegative-cost-function-and-a-set-of-constraints">1) A combinatorial problem with a nonnegative cost function and a set of constraints.</h4>
<h4 id="2-a-neural-network-that-produces-a-probability-for-each-node-this-is-the-probability-that-the-node-belongs-to-the-set-s">2) A neural network that produces a probability for each node. This is the probability that the node belongs to the set \(S\).</h4>
<h4 id="3-a-differentiable-loss-function-this-loss-takes-as-input-the-probabilities-that-were-produced-by-the-network-the-loss-will-be-derived-from-your-problems-objective-i-will-explain-below">3) A differentiable loss function. This loss takes as input the probabilities that were produced by the network. The loss will be derived from your problem’s objective (I will explain below).</h4>

<h4 id="technical-detail">Technical Detail:</h4>
<p>In the paper, we use Bernoulli variables over the nodes of the input graph. You could work with other distributions as well, but if you are unsure I recommend starting with Bernoulli  random variables over the entities you care about (over nodes/edges/tuples/etc.). We will need to derive an expectation of a function over those random variables and it happens that Bernoulli variables tend to lead to easier derivations.
For the rest of the post \(x_i\) is a Bernoulli random variable placed on node \(i\),</p>

\[x_i= \begin{cases} 1, \quad \text{with probability } p_i  \\
0, \quad \text{with probability } 1-p_i .
\end{cases}\]

<h2 id="how-to-solve-it">How to solve it</h2>

<p>Now, suppose you have a combinatorial problem. You need to follow the steps below.</p>
<h3 id="step-1">Step 1:</h3>
<p>Write down the cost function of your problem, for example in our paper we consider the maximum clique problem.
Here is the standard way of expressing it:</p>
<h4 id="maximize-weights-subject-to-s-is-a-clique">maximize weight(\(S\)), subject to: \(S\) is a clique.</h4>
<p>For a simple undirected graph, weight(S) (henceforth \(w(S)\)) just counts the number of edges in the subgraph induced by S. 
To be in line with the paper, we need to switch to a  minimization problem, hence:</p>
<h4 id="minimize-gamma-ws-subject-to-s-is-a-clique">minimize \(\gamma-w(S)\), subject to: \(S\) is a clique.</h4>
<p>\(\gamma\) here is a sufficiently large constant;  Let \(\gamma \geq \text{max}_{S}(w(S))\), so that the expression remains always nonnegative.</p>
<hr />

<h3 id="step-2">Step 2:</h3>
<p>Set up a graph neural network (the choice of model depends on the task and engineering considerations) for your data. Using any of the mainstream
GNNs (GIN, GAT, etc.) should be fine to start with.
The GNN takes as input some node features. Its output is an N x 1 vector of probabilities, one for each node.
For the specifics on features, layers, normalizations, etc. you can just look at the code in the repo. Or you may improve upon the pipeline by working with your own features, layers, etc.</p>
<hr />

<h3 id="step-3">Step 3:</h3>
<p>Derive a differentiable loss.
The differentiable loss function has to look like this:</p>
<h4 id="loss--expected-cost--beta--ps-does-not-satisfy-constraints">Loss = Expected Cost + \(\beta\) * P(S does not satisfy constraints).</h4>
<p>\(\beta\) here is a coefficient that controls the importance of the constraint in the loss. 
The expectation of the cost can be straightforward for many set functions. 
For the Prob(S does not satisfy constraints)  term (henceforth \(P(S \notin \Omega)\)), we can use Markov’s inequality to bound it.</p>

<h3 id="example">Example:</h3>
<p>First, derive the expected cost. In our max-clique example, \(\text{cost} = \gamma-w(S)\).
\(\gamma\) is just a constant so \(E[cost] = \gamma - E[w(S)]\).
We have \(w(S) = \sum_{(i,j) \in E}x_i x_j\) where \(E\) is the set of edges of the graph.</p>

<p>In other words, an edge \((i,j)\) is in  \(S\) if both endpoints \(i\) and \(j\) are in  \(S\).
We are using Bernoulli variables, therefore:
\(E[w(S)] = \sum_{(i,j)\in E}p_i p_j.\)</p>

<p>OK, now onto the constraint part of the loss.
For the maximum clique problem, the constraint dictates that <strong>the subgraph induced by S is a clique</strong>, i.e, all pairs of nodes in S are connected by an edge.
An equivalent way to phrase this is that, <strong>there are no edges in the complement of the subgraph induced by S</strong>.
Let \(\bar{S}\) be the complement of S. Then,</p>
<h4 id="ps-notin-omega---pwbars1">\(P(S \notin \Omega)  = P(w(\bar{S})&gt;=1).\)</h4>
<p>From Markov’s inequality, this can be bounded as follows</p>
<h4 id="pwbars1-leq-ewbars">\(P(w(\bar{S})&gt;=1) \leq E[w(\bar{S})].\)</h4>
<p>So our loss ends up being</p>
<h4 id="textloss--gamma---ews--beta-ewbars">\(\text{Loss} = \gamma - E[w(S)] + \beta E[w(\bar{S})].\)</h4>

<hr />

<h3 id="step-4">Step 4:</h3>
<p>Train the network using the derived loss. This is straightforward because you just have to plug in the probabilities in the expression and do backprop.</p>
<hr />

<h3 id="step-5">Step 5:</h3>
<p>Retrieve the set \(S\) from the probabilities of the network using the method of conditional expectation.
It works as follows.</p>

<p>Sort the nodes according to their probabilities.
Starting from the high probability nodes, for each node \(v_i\) do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Evaluate the loss for \(p_i=1\) and for \(p_i=0\).</li>
  <li>Set  \(p_i\) to either 1 or 0 depending on what achieved the better loss.</li>
  <li>Move on to the next node and repeat from step 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>When this is done, you should have a binary (indicator) vector that represents your set \(S\), which is the solution to your problem.
Congrats! That’s it, you’re done.</p>

<!--     <div class="entry-content">
        <p>The Matrix franchise has been in the spotlight for the past few months due to the release of the fourth installment “The Matrix: Resurrections”. The discussions I see online have reminded me how misunderstood the sequels are. It’s no secret that I love the franchise. It’s absolutely packed with symbolism and cool ideas that over the years keep impressing me with how bold and ambitious they are. In this post, I will focus on one of the key concepts that makes its appearance in the third film: the golden light. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/eNO90eB.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eNO90eB.jpg" alt="Machine City" /></a></p>

<p>As a quick refresher, starting from the end of the second film, we can see that Neo is able to “feel” the sentinels and even shut them down at will. He is also destroying sentinels en masse on his way to the machine city while Trinity is driving, even though he can’t even see them. People have argued that he has somehow gained access to a kind of wireless connection to the machines through his interaction with the source in the second film. I don’t think this holds up as an explanation because in the third film, he is blinded by Bane (who is possessed by Smith) and we can clearly see that he is able to see Smith in the form of golden light inside Bane’s flesh even though he’s blind. There are no mechanical parts in Bane (well, except for the holes I suppose), his consciousness has just been altered by Smith. Furthermore, he can perceive the entire machine city as formations of golden light. Whatever effect the source had on Neo seems to transcend ordinary electronic circuits.</p>

<p>Below I will provide a more philosophical (and speculative) account of what the golden light is and how it connects to Neo’s abilities based on material that has been released either with the movies or after them.
If you expect a strictly mechanistic explanation of everything you will probably be disappointed. This is more of a loose attempt at putting things together and as such, we probably need to tone down the scientist in us a little bit. There are certain interpretative jumps that need to be taken which (in my view) are quite consistent with information that is presented in the movies and other media from the Wachowskis themselves.</p>

<p>So… let’s get the obvious stuff out of the way. Apart from pure curiosity, what makes the golden light worth discussing? 
From the philosopher’s commentary with Dr. Cornel West and Ken Wilber as well as the comments by Lana Wachowski in <a href="https://www.matrixfans.net/symbolism-philosophy-and-allegory/the-many-meanings-of-the-matrix/">a discussion between Lana and Ken Wilber</a>,
it becomes clear that the gold light that Neo perceives in the city of Machines has major conceptual significance for the trilogy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ken Wilber: As you know, I think it’s incredibly gutsy because the whole key
to the Matrix trilogy—this is my interpretation—is given in really in
the last fifteen, twenty minutes of the third film; that the Rosetta
Stone is when Neo, for example, is saying of the machines, “If you
could only see them like I see em…they’re all light.  They’re made
of light”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just Ken Wilber’s interpretation though. However, he does point out that he has “corroborated” his interpretation with the Wachowskis to some extent. Here’s what Lana had to say
in an <a href="https://youtu.be/ARoKJ00cEZ8?t=4246">interview</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If you basically work on what the trilogy is all about, you come to this symbol that is never discussed… and yet it’s there clearly. The third movie actually begins with the gold light as a part of the opening title montage. As if to say that…look, this is an essential element. It’s as important as the matrix code is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My central claim in this post is that the golden light is meant to symbolize <span style="color:rgb(255, 166, 0)">spirit</span> 
. 
I will do my best to explain what that means and why this view makes sense. Additionally, I’ll provide you with sources that support this claim and I’ll briefly go over them to describe what each source suggests.</p>

<h2 style="color:rgb(255, 166, 0); font-family:Calibri;font-size: 22px;font-weight:100;">Opening Sequence</h2>

<p>The golden light appears in the opening sequence of the Matrix Revolutions. In the youtube video I linked, Lana explains that the opening sequence tries to provide a visual “summary” of what the film is about. You can watch the sequence <a href="https://youtu.be/cYEcjGi_kv0?t=42">on this link</a>.</p>

<p>The sequence begins with an explosion of golden light symbolizing the Big Bang, and an emergence of fractal patterns which are most likely a rendering of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set">Julia set</a>. As the camera keeps zooming inside the fractals, it eventually reaches a depiction of the machine city. Fractals exhibit self-similarity and (roughly speaking) are produced by an iterative process that converges for certain points and diverges for others. Fractals are rather generic entities that have been used in all sorts of metaphors so by themselves they’re not enough to draw any solid conclusion. Following the fractals we zoom out to matrix code and a panoramic view of the matrix Megacity which looks like a symbol. So the Matrix and the Megacity appear to be layered <em>on top</em> of the golden light in this sequence.</p>

<p>Given Lana’s comments and that the golden light is shown to underlie the matrix and the Megacity, it is fair to assume at this point that it’s a fundamental layer of the story, and given the Big Bang depiction, of reality as presented in the matrix.
How do we know it’s supposed to be the Big Bang and not some flashy random explosion? Well, here’s the quote from Lana in the discussion with Ken Wilber:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That was the…  in the beginning of the third movie when there’s like… we’re like: “How do we start the third movie? Which is gonna talk about the things that are so hard to talk about?”  It’s like: Ok, you go to black and then you have to have a moment of Big Bang and that’s the origin of everything, the origin of thought, the origin of consciousness, whatever it is—in that moment it’s like ‘from that nothing to everything’ is everything… [Ken laughs]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given the title of the movie and the emphasis of the franchise on repeated patterns (for example the cycle of Zion being “rebooted” by the machines through the One), it can be fair to connect the fractal to the concept of “Revolutions”, in the sense of repeating processes that revolve around a certain point. The fractals can be viewed as a loose visual metaphor for said revolutions. Furthermore, the self-similarity may be viewed as reflecting the different layers of the story that share similar characteristics. For example, the power struggle between Neo and Smith in the Matrix can be seen to reflect the larger struggle of humans and machines. The underlying fabric of those cycles and power struggles is the golden light, i.e., spirit. But what does that even mean? This is still all very vague, so let’s get into it.</p>

<p>To explain in more detail we will need to introduce some key concepts that will be essential to understanding those connections.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I am not a philosopher and I have read about those things only in online lecture material, blog posts, and online encyclopedias. I’m sure there will be people that find this too crude or even incorrect. That’s just my reading of the material and more particularly, how I think the Wachowskis understood and interpreted this material to connect it to the Matrix. Of course, I don’t know them and I’ve never talked to them so that’s just me piecing things together in a way that hopefully makes sense.</p>

<h2 style="color:rgb(255, 166, 0); font-family:Calibri;font-size: 22px;font-weight:100;">Spirit</h2>

<p>So, what is spirit?
There are multiple accounts of what constitutes spirit. One of the most widely discussed realizations of the concept comes from the philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel">Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
</a>. In the article by Rex Martin “The World Spirit” we read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The main speculative claim of Hegelian philosophy is that the totality
of human history is a single whole and the work of one Spirit (a World
Spirit or World-Historical Spirit), i.e., of human activity taken en
bloc, as a single collectivity. The entire history of the world is to
be viewed as a single “life”, as the career of one self or person.
World History is a self-organizing process. What happens in World
History is the progressive actualization of the only truly individual
person or self (the World Spirit).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the bottom line is that the history of the world is meant to be viewed as the journey of self-actualization of spirit. To a non-philosopher like myself this sounds
like a borderline religious claim, but there’s more. Spirit is meant to be perceived almost as a different state of matter. It is not localized in individuals, minds, or objects.
It is meant to inhabit another realm where the “collective-consciousness” of an entire society resides. In some sense, you can view spirit as encoding fundamental progress towards
a greater self-awareness (often referred to as “self-consciousness”) of the universe.</p>

<p>Here’s another quote from Lana regarding Hegel during the discussion with Ken Wilber:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It’s the whole process, that mystical—that Eros that you talk about, that’s underneath everything, has been bringing us toward the development of self-awareness and consciousness.  Well I guess consciousness, and then self-awareness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But how is this progress towards universal “self-consciousness” achieved?
Before we get into that, check out this quote about the trilogy from a recent <a href="https://youtu.be/LQYGbuxYgGg?t=314">interview</a> that Lana Wachowski did:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“We wrote it as an elegant structure that was <strong>dialectical</strong> in nature… It was resonant with ideas of birth, life, death… and <strong>thesis,</strong>
<strong>antithesis, synthesis…</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, Hegel postulated that spirit  evolves in a dialectical manner. What does that mean? First, let’s understand the other concept from the quote.</p>

<h2 style="color:rgb(255, 166, 0); font-family:Lato;font-size: 22px;font-weight:100;">Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis</h2>

<p>From the Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This “textbook” Being-Nothing-Becoming example is closely connected to
the traditional idea that Hegel’s dialectics follows a
thesis-antithesis-synthesis pattern, which, when applied to the logic,
means that one concept is introduced as a “thesis” or positive
concept, which then develops into a second concept that negates or is
opposed to the first or is its “antithesis”, which in turn leads to a
third concept, the “synthesis”, that unifies the first two.
…
Being is the positive moment or thesis, Nothing is the negative moment or antithesis, and Becoming is the moment of aufheben or synthesis—the concept that cancels and preserves, or unifies and combines, Being and Nothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis can be used to describe the evolution of a logical argument. This is what Lana means when she says that the structure was dialectical. We start with a proposition (thesis). Then a contradiction in that proposition leads to a counter-proposition (antithesis).
Those are reconciled by creating a new proposition which combines the two.
Neo’s struggle with Smith can be metaphorically viewed in those terms.
Essentially, starting from a thesis (Neo) a contradiction arises which leads
to the creation of antithesis (Smith). How the contradiction (and therefore Smith) emerged is handwaved away in Reloaded. All we get is that there’s something teleological about his existence (“it happened for a reason”). These two have to be reconciled through synthesis; a new entity that combines the previous ones. This is the moment where Neo gets absorbed by Smith and through Deus-Ex-Machina achieves peace.</p>

<h2 style="color:rgb(255, 166, 0); font-family:Calibri;font-size: 22px;font-weight:100;">Master-Slave Dialectic</h2>

<p>Now back into the evolution of spirit.
Hegel in “The Phenomenology of Spirit” explained that consciousness of individuals culminates into spirit through interactions with other individual consciousnesses. This happens
when one consciousness is able to <em>recognize</em> another consciousness and place it on equal footing with itself. This occurs in history through the Master-Slave dialectic. In
the article “Hegel’s Master-Slave Dialectic: the search for self-consciousness” by J.D. Feilmeier we read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hegel’s Master-Slave dialectic tells the story of two independent “self-consciousnesses” who encounter one another and engage in a life-and-death struggle. The two self-consciousnesses must struggle because each one sees the other as a threat to itself. Until the confrontation, each self-consciousness has seen itself as the measure of all things. Its feelings, desires, powers, etc. have been the objective standard by which all things encountered have been measured. Now, however, the presence of another self-consciousness establishes a new objective standard -the feelings, desires, and powers of each self-consciousness are subjective standards which must be measured against the new objective standards – the feelings, desires, and powers of the other. This affirmation of self-consciousness requires a struggle to the death because each self-consciousness can only become aware of Its limits by exerting itself to a maximum effort. Each self-consciousness must struggle with all its might in order to realize the extent of its strength in relation to the other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, we can sort of see a parallel here between Neo and Smith (humans and machines) and those two “self-consciousnesses”. Neo stands for <strong>choice and free will</strong> while Smith represents <strong>fate and purpose</strong>. They represent radically conflicting worldviews and they do engage in a death struggle. The connection is still kind of loose though, so we keep reading:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The significance of its existence which each individual fought so fiercely to establish is fully realized by the slave rather than the master. In winning the struggle, the master has affirmed his power over the slave, yet the master has failed to recognize that he is not god. The slave, however, recognizes his limitedness, slavery to the master “Is his chain, from which he could not, in the struggle, get away, and for that reason he proves himself dependent, shows that his independence consists in his being a thing.” (Hegel, p.405) Only in being subdued and forced to see himself as merely an object, is it possible for the slave to become fully aware of his place in the universe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, it is essential for the slave to completely submit in order gain awareness.
This keeps getting closer to what happened in the film. At the end of Revolutions, Neo is completely vulnerable in front of both Smith and Deus-Ex-Machina.
Neo had to concede to Smith and let himself be absorbed. Not only does he physically surrender, but on another level we also have free will submitting to fate by having Neo accept the inevitability of what will happen. “You were always right. It was inevitable”. That allowed Deus-Ex-Machina to use Neo as a way to liberate the Matrix from Smith.
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/SexHdvh.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SexHdvh.jpg" alt="You were right" /></a></p>

<p>Now, let’s take a quick look at the wiki for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_dialectic">Master-Slave dialectic</a>. We read:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Crucially, for Hegel, absolute knowledge (Spirit) cannot come to be without first a self-consciousness recognizing another self-consciousness. He maintained that the entire reality is immediately present to self-consciousness. It undergoes three stages of development:
<strong>Desire</strong>, where self-consciousness is directed at things other than itself.
<strong>Master-slave</strong>, where the self-consciousness is directed at another that is unequal to itself.
<strong>Universal self-conscious</strong>, where the self-conscious recognizes itself in another.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And a few lines below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A struggle to the death ensues. However, if one of the two should die, the achievement of self-consciousness fails. Hegel refers to this failure as “abstract negation” not the negation or sublation required. This death is avoided by the agreement, communication of, or subordination to, slavery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thematically, it appears that Neo’s role was essentially the role of achieving self-consciousness by engaging in a death struggle with Smith and ultimately surrendering. In those moments, we see the shots of golden light completely overtaking Neo. At that point we’re seeing the emergence of Spirit. <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8cUUh.jpg"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8cUUh.jpg" alt="enter image description here" /></a></p>

<p>You could argue that I’m reaching quite a bit to get this interpretation so let’s bring some more evidence to back this up.
The most important clue is the final level of the game “The Matrix: Path of Neo”.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgg7FdznyQg">Here</a> is the excerpt where Lana (as Larry at the time) discusses the final scene of Revolutions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You see, at this point in the story, Neo stands on the verge of
satori, ready to resolve the paradox of choice and choicelessness, of
free will versus fate, but that can only be achieved through an act of
surrender, which occurs after he has abandoned the perspectival nature
of truth, accepting the totality of present consciousness which
ultimately allows an evolutionary transition, transcending the
Cartesian dilemma through the emergence of delimited  <span style="color:rgb(255, 166, 0)">spirit</span>, which
then provides the world with the choice of a third path, the path of
Neo, the path of peace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, this seems familiar, doesn’t it? I will focus on one line for the sake of brevity and the rest can be more or less understood with a little bit of extra effort.
“…accepting the totality of present consciousness which ultimately allows an evolutionary transition, transcending the Cartesian dilemma through the emergence of delimited spirit”.</p>

<p>By Cartesian dilemma, Lana refers to the mind-body duality as it manifests through the Matrix and Zion. In the trilogy, the world of the body is the world of Zion and the city of Machines. There, everything is colored in blue tones. The Matrix represents the world of the mind and is always colored in green tones (Ken Wilber highlights this repeatedly in the philosopher’s commentary versions of the movies). Then Neo, by acknowledging Smith’s perspective (“you were right”) and surrendering leads to the emergence of spirit (golden light) and is able to reconcile the worlds of body and mind (the Matrix returns back to its normal state).</p>

<p>As Neo ends the war and people in Zion realize that the war is over, the track playing in the background is called <span style="color:rgb(255, 166, 0)">“Spirit of the Universe”</span>, composed by Don Davis.
Furthermore, the significance of the blue and green colors makes a subtle appearance in that last sequence. This is how the city of the machines looks like right before Neo engages in the final battle:

<p>After Neo succeeds, the lights in the machine city are beginning to turn green:

Given Lana’s words about transcending the Cartesian dilemma, it’s fair to assume that this is a deliberate choice, meant to signify the unification of the worlds of mind and body.</p>

<p>So, why does it even make sense to go there? What is the point of invoking all those philosophical ideas? Well, apart from serving as great literary devices, we need to remember where the Matrix started from.
Starting with the first, the main character is forced to completely revise his framework for understanding the world as he realizes that he was trapped in a simulated reality. Upon re-evaluating his worldview and assuming the role of the one, he realizes that this new framework has to be re-evaluated as well, as it’s yet another system of control laid out by the machines. Naturally, by the end of Reloaded we can wonder
whether this process of re-evaluating the framework for understanding the world ever “bottoms out”. That’s where Revolutions comes. It aims to provide an account of how a kind of “ultimate knowledge” (spirit of the universe) emerges during the confrontation of entities with conflicting views and categorizations of the world. It is through those conflicts that spirit self-actualizes and Neo, along with Trinity and other key characters like the Oracle, are the vessels of this discovery in the trilogy.</p>

<p>Lana in her interview says about the golden light:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>That light is what the third movie is trying to solve, post deconstructing something like choice. You can say choice is important, choice is a part of everyone’s lives… but that paradigm of choice is not different, it’s a matrix just like Catholicism or Christianity…
…a tool for understanding the world, having a framework of meaning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the grander level of this narrative, we have humans developing AI which reflects a new kind of consciousness. This type of consciousness has a completely mechanistic view of the world, and its value system
revolves around the ability to mathematically account for everything. Their power to model the world and predict outcomes makes them view the world as predetermined. This clashes with the worldview of humans
which stand for the values of choice and free will. A master-slave dialectic between the humans and machines emerges. As machines shape the world through servitude to humans, they become independent from humans. From Hegel’s ‘Philosophy of World History’:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“The humankind has not liberated itself from servitude but by means of servitude.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, this is flipped and applies to machines in the trilogy. Now, in this master-slave struggle machines gain the upper hand. In Reloaded, we learn that the Architect can not comprehend humans. He epitomizes the values of machines that are diametrically opposed to the human ones. The Oracle also explicitly tells Neo that the Architect can’t understand humans.  However, we see that the Oracle begins to gain an appreciation for human nature. As we saw above, spirit emerges through an act of mutual recognition between conflicting sides. That is, the values of the machines and the values of humans would somehow have to be reconciled. This manifests with the Oracle’s plan that creates a new version of the One. Recall that previous matrix versions failed because humans were not given a (subconscious) choice to participate. This solution of incorporating choice was discovered by the Oracle.</p>

<p>The recognition of the values of the machines comes through Neo’s acknowledgement of inevitability and his surrender. From the machine side, I believe that this acknowledgement is best reflected in the last line of the film. Seraph asks the Oracle if she always knew what would happen. Her response is ‘No. But I believed’. We see that the Oracle’s actions clearly display values that are strictly representative of humans (choice, hope, and belief). First she was able to realize how choice is integral for humans. Then she herself embraces the human ‘framework of meaning’. This is what allowed spirit to emerge and the peaceful coexistence of humans and machines to be achieved.</p>

<p>And this is why I find Revolutions to be the most ambitious sequel. It provids a bold and idealistic view for the evolution of history in terms of the evolution of spirit. I’m not particularly spiritual in my life, but spiritual themes can be great at driving narratives in movies and this is what appears to be happening here.
I love how the Wachowskis decided to go about this one.
While those ideas are not always explicitly detailed in the movie, this is in part because the Wachowskis intended this to be a puzzle for people to analyze. 
The pieces of the puzzle are there, although arguably not entirely contained in the trilogy. As a viewer, you can either decide to dismiss all of those things as arbitrary aesthetic decisions, or take into account the clues that are available and piece it all together. It’s quite likely that some of the connections I drew here are half-baked and more crisp explanations may exist. I do think that the g(e)ist of what I’m describing gets fairly close to what the Wachowskis intended.
I have also left out parts like the religious references of the trilogy. 
I may come back to write a few things about how those ideas relate to spirit, but for now… it is done.</p>

<p>I will just end this post with a quote from Hegel’s “Philosophy of Nature” which I find rather fitting:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>All cultural change reduces itself to a difference of categories. All revolutions, whether in the sciences or world history, occur merely because spirit has changed its categories in order to understand and examine what belongs to it, in order to possess and grasp itself in a truer, deeper, more intimate and unified manner.</p>
