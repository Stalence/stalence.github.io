Below I will provide a more philosophical (and speculative) account of what the golden light is, based on material that has been released either with the movies or after them. There are certain interpretative jumps that need to be taken but in my view this is quite consistent with information that is presented in the movies and other media from the Wachowski's themselves. Finally, even though this is a philosophical perspective, it does materialize when we see Neo destroy sentinels, when they touch him without entering the ship (your question), when he sees Smith while being blind, etc.

From the philosopher's commentary with Dr. Cornel West and Ken Wilber as well as the comments by Lana Wachowski in
[A discussion between Lana and Ken wilber][1] (timestamped),
it becomes clear that the gold light that Neo perceives in the city of Machines has major conceptual significance for the trilogy.

I claim that the golden light in the trilogy is meant to symbolize **spirit**. 
I will do my best to explain what that means and why this view makes sense. Additionally, I'll provide you with sources that support this claim and I'll briefly go over them to describe what each source suggests.

**Introduction**

The golden light appears in the opening sequence of the Matrix Revolutions. In the youtube video I linked, Lana explains that the opening sequence (with the golden light) tries to provide a visual "summary" of what the film is about. You can watch the sequence [on this link][2].

[![Julia set opening sequence][3]][3]
The sequence begins with an explosion of golden light (symbolizing the big bang) and an emergence of fractal patterns (which are most likely a rendering of a [Julia set][4]). Fractals exhibit self-similarity and (roughly speaking) are produced by an iterative process that "converges" for certain points and "diverges" for others. Fractals are rather generic entities that have been used in all sorts of metaphors so by themselves they're not enough to draw any solid conclusion.
Following the fractals we see a panoramic view of the matrix Megacity that when zooming out, looks like a symbol. So the Matrix and the Megacity appear to be layered *on top* of the golden light in this sequence. Therefore, the golden light can be interpreted as a fundamental layer of the story, and given the big bang depiction, of reality.

How do we know it's supposed to be the Big Bang and not some flashy random explosion? Well, here's the quote from Lana in the discussion with Ken wilber:

> That was the...  in the beginning of the third movie when there's like... we're like: "How do we start the third movie? Which is gonna talk about the things that are so hard to talk about?”  It's like: Ok, you go to black and then you have to have a moment of Big Bang and that's the origin of everything, the origin of thought, the origin of consciousness, whatever it is—in that moment it's like 'from that nothing to everything' is everything... [Ken laughs]

 
Given the title of the movie and the emphasis of the franchise on repeated patterns (for example the cycle of Zion being "rebooted" by the machines through the One), it can be fair to connect the fractal to the concept of "Revolutions", in the sense of "repeating processes that revolve around a certain point". The fractals can be viewed as a loose visual metaphor for said revolutions. Furthermore, the self-similarity may be viewed as reflecting the different layers of the story that share similar characteristics. For example, the power struggle between Neo and Smith in the Matrix can be seen to reflect the larger struggle of humans and machines. The underlying fabric of those cycles and power struggles is the golden light, i.e., spirit.


To explain this in more detail we will need to introduce some key concepts that will be essential to understanding those connections.

**Disclaimer**: I am not a philosopher and I have read about those things only in online lecture material, blog posts, and online encyclopedias. I'm sure there will be people that find this too crude or even incorrect. That's just my reading of the material and more particularly, how I think the Wachowskis understood and interpreted this material to connect it to the Matrix. Of course, I don't know them and I've never talked to them so that's just me piecing things together in a way that hopefully makes sense.

**Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis**

From the Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy:

> This “textbook” Being-Nothing-Becoming example is closely connected to
> the traditional idea that Hegel’s dialectics follows a
> thesis-antithesis-synthesis pattern, which, when applied to the logic,
> means that one concept is introduced as a “thesis” or positive
> concept, which then develops into a second concept that negates or is
> opposed to the first or is its “antithesis”, which in turn leads to a
> third concept, the “synthesis”, that unifies the first two.
> ...
> Being is the positive moment or thesis, Nothing is the negative moment or antithesis, and Becoming is the moment of aufheben or synthesis—the concept that cancels and preserves, or unifies and combines, Being and Nothing.

In a recent [interview][5], Lana briefly mentions this about the trilogy:
> "It was resonant with ideas of birth, life, death... and thesis,
> antithesis, synthesis..."

Consider the example of Neo and Smith. The oracle explains that Smith is Neo's opposite (antithesis) and "...he won't stop until nothing is left at all". Indeed, what ends up happening is that instead of one or the other prevailing, Neo allows Smith to absorb him and this synthesis, so to speak, allows the Machines to control Smith and ends the war. In those final moments when Smith is destroyed you can see Neo being covered in golden light (spirit).[![enter image description here][6]][6]. 

Why do I call it spirit? Well, here's an excerpt from the final level of the game "The Matrix: Path of Neo", where Lana discusses the final scene of Revolutions:

>  You see, at this point in the story, Neo stands on the verge of
> satori, ready to resolve the paradox of choice and choicelessness, of
> free will versus fate, but that can only be achieved through an act of
> surrender, which occurs after he has abandoned the perspectival nature
> of truth, accepting the totality of present consciousness which
> ultimately allows an evolutionary transition, transcending the
> Cartesian dilemma through the emergence of delimited spirit, which
> then provides the world with the choice of a third path, the path of
> Neo, the path of peace.

OK, this seems like a bunch of gibberish, but it turns out that it's informative to some extent if we look closer. I will focus on one line for the sake of brevity and the rest can be more or less understood with a little bit of extra effort.
"...which ultimately allows an evolutionary transition, transcending the Cartesian dilemma through the emergence of delimited spirit"

This line corresponds to the gold light that we mentioned above. By Cartesian dilemma, Lana refers to the mind-body duality as it manifests through the Matrix and Zion. In the trilogy, the world of the body is the world of Zion and the city of Machines. There, everything is colored blue. The Matrix represents the world of the mind and is always colored green. Then Neo, through the emergence of spirit (golden light) is able to offer the path of peace. 

** SPIRIT ** 
So, what is spirit? There are multiple accounts of what constitutes Spirit, at least in the sense described in Hegel's writings.
In the article by Rex Martin "The World Spirit" we read:

> The main speculative claim of Hegelian philosophy is that the totality
> of human history is a single whole and the work of one Spirit (a World
> Spirit or World-Historical Spirit), i.e., of human activity taken en
> bloc, as a single collectivity. The entire history of the world is to
> be viewed as a single "life", as the career of one self or person.
> World History is a self-organizing process. What happens in World
> History is the progressive actualization of the only truly individual
> person or self (the World Spirit).

OK, there's 1 comment pointing to spirit and there's the philosopher's commentary. 


The title also obviously connects at a more obvious level with the "revolution" of humans against the perceived tyranny of the machines.
 I think the interpretative jump that connects to the title "revolutions" has to do with the concept of repeating cycles 



I am not trying to argue about whether there is a mechanistic interpretation of what happens with the golden light (i.e., whether it can be seen as some kind of wireless connection), my point is that **regardless of the mechanistic explanation**, the intention of the golden light as a plot device is to hint towards a deeper fundamental reality.
